# Cave-Seeker is a game developed by Octavio Mercedes as part of the final project for CPSC 4970


The objective is simple. Although you might be frustrated and will have to restart, the game is modeled after an old arcade where you have to keep inserting coins (pressing esc) to keep playing. Dont give up though! Catch chungus while youre at it! 

Let me know your thoughts & thank you for an awesome semester!
