## About The Project

The objective is simple. Although you might be frustrated and will have to restart, the game is modeled after an old arcade where you have to keep inserting coins (pressing esc) to keep playing. Dont give up though! Catch chungus while youre at it! press F1 to advance, run past chungus & reach the end!
